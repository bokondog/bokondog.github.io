      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="card" id="intro">
        <p><strong>Anything can be improved.</strong> With a skillset centered around <em>critical thinking</em> and
          <em>technical analysis</em>, I look
          for opportunities to <em>improve</em>, both myself and my environment. As a true nerd, I adore the process
          of
          <em>knowledge acquisition</em>, which enables me to quickly <em>adapt</em> to new environments.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>My <em>patience</em>, <em>perseverance</em>, and <em>analytical mindset</em> enable me to tackle even the
          most complex problems,
          typically with a healthy dose of humor along the way. My <em>experience in customer service</em> has
          trained
          me to
          communicate efficiently in <em>three languages</em> (NL/FR/EN).</p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>Solidarity</em>, <em>empathy</em>, and <em>compassion</em> have been indispensible in pursuing
          improvement, and continue to
          inspire me to stay true to myself in my interaction with others, with <em>respect</em> for the needs and
          expectations
          of others.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>As a software developer with <em>3 years of industry experience</em>, I am currently looking for a
          dynamic
          work
          environment that will enable and support my continued <em>growth</em>.</p>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>In this section, I'll be taking you through a variety of recent experiences, reflections, projects,
          schedules,
          and assignments. While I typically prefer to keep things a bit more terse, I will be going into more detail
          where specifically required.</p>
        <p>It's been interesting to list up all the experienced I've had in recent years,
          and looking back on them, I am able to express both my gratitude for the lessons learned and the people who
          supported my growth, as well as express my disappointment with avoidable setbacks and missed opportunities.
          Hopefully, this document provides a look into my journey as a software developer. Bookmark this page to stay

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <h4>Why programming?</h4> <!-- (8-15 lines/100-200 words for each subsection) -->
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Why this educational track?</h5>
          <p>I already have experience, but I am lacking a higher educational degree. In my time as a software
            developer,
            I
            noticed insufficiencies in my fundamental knowledge, inhibiting further growth. After nearly burning myself
            out
            at my previous employer, I took this opportunity to further my education at the beginning of my professional
            career, rather than suffering through the lack of knowledge for the next several years. While, in theory,
            continuous education and self-improvement should be the cornerstone of each creative professional's process,
            I've found that, in practice, all that matters to the business is <em>building working software</em>. In
            some
            circumstances, such as with ambitious startups, this can come at the cost of a developer's personal
            development.
            In other words, <strong>I'm making up for lost time.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Why would the job suit you?</h5>
          <p><strong>I love solving problems.</strong> While I feel that about sums it up, the school assignment for
            which
            this portfolio was written mandates that I continue for a while longer, so I will. For most people,
            interacting
            with a new piece of technology usually centers around the "what?", as in: <em>"what can it do?"</em> This is
            by
            all means the most important question to ask, because if what it can do is worthless, so is the product,
            along
            with any time and effort expended during its creation. Heartbreaking.</p>
          <br>
          <p> But there are other questions we can ask, such as:</p>
          <br>
          <ul class="role-list">
            <li>"How does it work?"</li>
            <li>"Why does it work like that?"</li>
            <li>"Are there other ways to accomplish the same goal?"</li>
            <li>"How does this compare to similar technology?"</li>
            <li>"What enabled the innovation driving this project's success?"</li>
            <li>...</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>
            These questions are more commonly heard in conversations among people in IT and, more broadly speaking, in
            engineering. As far back as I remember, I could never quite <em>satisfy my curiosity</em> by simply answering the
            question "what can it do?". So, I developed the habit of reaching out, <em>exploring the available information</em>
            around me and researching whatever piques my interest. Over time, I noticed a huge benefit to this
            omnidirectional approach to learning. By going wherever my <em>intrinsic motivation</em> takes me, I've been able to
            assemble a <em>solid knowledge base</em>, spanning various fields of study. In effect, I've unwittingly developed
            <em>T-shaped skills</em> centered around software development.

          <h5>Designer</h5>
          <h6>Current status of progress</h6>
          <p>While my focus and interest is primarily on back end work, I was able to design quite a few <em>mockups,
            wireframes, and design proposals</em> while working as a software developer. These would often serve to gain
            approval and buy-in from a Product Owner, stakeholder, or the scrum team. In some cases, they would serve to
            <em>visually clarify requirements</em> for developers being onboarded onto the project, or to <em>dial in specific details</em> during
            the sprint. I've become competent in using tools such as <em>Whimsical</em> or <em>Figma</em> to quickly work out a simple
            mockup to be attached to a Jira ticket, as this was one of my responsibilities during my time as a P.O.</p>

          <h5>Programmer</h5>
          <h6>Current status of progress</h6>
          <p>Despite setbacks in terms of employer culture, I was able to learn a reasonable amount. After 3 years of
            working at a startup (infamous for their high demand for individual flexibility), I've been able to gain
            professional experience along all major components of a modern tech stack (<em>MEVN</em>, i.e.: MongoDB, Express,
            Vue,
            Node.js). Outside of work, I was able to
            <em>explore new technologies</em>, and <em>experiment with productivity methodologies</em>.</p>

          <h5>Tester</h5>
          <h6>Current status of progress</h6>
          <p>I've had plenty of opportunities to <em>experiment with testing methodologies</em> and various tools. But what stuck
            with me most is, when push comes to shove, how little people end up caring about testing. Too often is it
            seen as optional, or something to do when there is extra time, as opposed to an integral part of the
            development
            process. At Oakfields, we struggled with aligning requirements from the business analysis phase with
            testable requirements at the end of the sprint, leading to many disagreements about whether or not a ticket
            was done. To resolve this, I proposed a simple workflow in which the user stories would need to be provided
            in a testable format (e.g.: <em>"if... when... then..."</em>) so that tests could be provided as both a <em>requirement
            checklist</em> during development as well as a <em>test suite</em> after release. The proposal was rejected for the reason
            of "too much effort", and so we continued writing vague requirements in analysis, no tests to match. The
            disagreements also continued.</p>

          <h5>Communicator/Team player</h5>
          <h6>Current status of progress</h6>
          <p>At this stage of my career, I have about <em>4 years of callcenter experience</em>, as well as <em>3 years of software
            development experience</em>. The callcenter work did wonders for my ability to stay <em>calm under pressure</em> and
            <em>communicate clearly</em>, as well as teaching how to <em>prioritize and compromise</em> within a large team to provide
            customer delight at every level. These skills came in handy as a software developer, where soft skills are
            anything but guaranteed! My time in the callcenter made me feel a lot more <em>comfortable with talking to
            stakeholders</em> in a professional and productive way, and while it was definitely challenging, it was a good
            type of challenge that I am in retrospect very grateful to have experienced.</p>

          <h5>Lifetime learner as IT-professional</h5>
          <h6>Current status of progress</h6>
          <p>In the past 5 years, I've gone from working in a callcenter to learning how to program, and becoming a
            fulltime software developer. During this time, I taught myself a vast amount of <em>new technology</em>, and I'm
            still <em>learning new information every day</em>. Overall, I think <em>knowledge aqcuisition is my strongest trait</em>, as I
            am able to pick up just about anything and get to an amateur level quite fast. It's also a major reason for
            choosing this profession, since I'll never run out of things to learn!</p>

        <h4>Three examples per role</h4>
        <p>The following section provides three examples of activities, divided by role. Each example comes
          directly from
          my personal experience in the field.</p>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Designer</h5>
          <h6>Mockup for mobile app</h6>
          <p>For the Riserva project, which centered around evaluating the performance of callcenter agents, I was
            tasked with building a mockup for the mobile version. I recieved positive feedback about the proposal, and
            learned a lot about translating general design principles to a smaller screen size.</p>
          <h6>Wireframe for development team</h6>
          <p>During a brief period as P.O. on the Mileviewer project, I would often have to design a basic wireframe to
            serve as a starting point for the front-end development team. I would then often support the back-end
            development myself.</p>
          <h6>Selecting new company logo</h6>
          <p>As part of a rebranding campaign, the entire team was involved in discussing and comparing various logo
            designs, providing feedback, and ultimately deciding how to proceed by voting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Programmer</h5>
          <h6>CSV upload feature</h6>
          <p>For the Mileviewer project, we needed a way to upload and process CSV data. The input would contain
            shipment information, each line of which needed to be parsed, evaluated, and processed. Users required a
            page on which to perform the upload, as well as feedback on the upload process, a history of uploads, and
            the ability to download previous uploads for review.
            One of my first big back-end tickets involved providing this functionality, under supervision and with
            support from the team lead. I later spent a lot of time supporting and extending the functionality myself.
          </p>
          <h6>Database entity copy feature</h6>
          <p>For the Mileviewer project, users would be assigned offices as a way to separate shipment information per
            location. Users required a convenient way to duplicate previously configured offices so that they no longer
            needed to manually copy information over to reuse it. I was tasked with developing this functionality,
            building on the previous experience with the CSV upload. It taught me a lot about how non-relational
            document databases (such as MongoDB) work.</p>
          <h6>Integration with external freight forwarder API</h6>
          <p>At a certain point in the Mileviewer project, we had expanded the upload and data transfer of the
            application to such an extent that the next big feature was an integration system, providing support for
            shipment data import from each major freight forwarder (e.g.: FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc...). Once again, I was
            tasked with the development
            of this feature. With incomplete analysis and a deadline, I got to work on gathering documentation, reaching
            out to support staff to clarify requirements for API key approval, writing documentation and briefing fellow
            team members on certain requirements. Slowly, at great personal cost, progress was made. I remember these
            couple of months of my career as the first time I didn't quite feel like a junior developer anymore, but
            I've never been quite clear on where exactly that distinction lies anyway.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Tester</h5>
          <h6>Testing plan in TestRail</h6>
          <p>I collaborated with my colleague Fred to provide a robust testing suite that would be reusable for all
            other projects, enabling us to accelerate development without getting blindsided by defects on launch day.
            In the end, it was all thrown in the bin.</p>
          <h6>Unit tests for business critical functionality</h6>
          <p>After some minor incidents with instability of the application, it was decided that unit test would be
            provided for at the very least the most critical parts of the application. These were written by me, and
            consequently forgotten about, even at my request to update them. The reason stated was higher priorities,
            but aren't there always?</p>
          <h6>Automate testing in CI/CD pipeline</h6>
          <p>We noticed that manual testing took a lot of time, and so I was tasked with automating a portion of the
            tests. I consulted my colleague Fred, and we collaborated to implement a useful BitBucket pipeline that
            could trigger a
            DeltaBlue deploy after running a specific test suite in TestRail, while also neatly updating ticket status
            in Jira!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Communicator/Team player</h5>
          <h6>Member of Agile team</h6>
          <p>For about 3 years, I have lived a life of Planning Meeting, Daily Standup, Review, Retrospective & Repeat.
            I'm no stranger to open communication, compromising, and delivering value! I would often lead effort to
            streamline our process for the benefit of our people (specifically the developer experience was becoming
            needlessly convoluted), but this was not always received in the most positive way.</p>
          <h6>Write technical documentation for external consumption of API</h6>
          <p>Since I worked up to be the teammember with the most knowledge & experience on the Mileviewer project, I
            was tasked with writing the technical documentation that would be used by one of our partners during the
            integration we were developing with their ERP. The documentation included a full OpenAPI specification
            document, and I acted as the primary person of contact to answer any questions from the external parties.
          </p>
          <h6>Customer support & stakeholder meetings</h6>
          <p>I was able to leverage my callcenter experience to provide trilingual customer support, and to support &
            educate my colleagues on best practices. Later, I also attended weekly stakeholder meetings to discuss goals
            on the Mileviewer project, functioning in the capacity of a tech lead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Lifetime learner as IT-professional</h5>
          <h6>Exploration of tools and languages</h6>
          <p>In my free time over the past year, I have started exploring the <a
              href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> programming languages,
            used a little Python while tinkering with <a href="https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET">the BirdNET
              project</a>, played with <a href="https://godotengine.org">the Godot game engine</a> to create a small
            shmup game, and learned how to use <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a> to prototype
            game
            concepts quickly.</p>
          <h6>Database sanitization script</h6>
          <p>To improve security, I was tasked to provide a database sanitization script that would strip sensitive
            personal information from our test database as part of an automated script in the devops pipeline.</p>
          <h6>Exploring Linux</h6>
          <p>As a lifetime Windows user, I only recently got to experience MacOS with my worklaptop being an M1 Macbook.
            I wanted to continue learning about other operating systems, in a continued effort to become as versatile as
            possible. I'd also like to improve my ability to remotely connect via terminal to work directly on remote
            servers (almost all of which run Linux), which has been necessary in the past to perform specific updates.
            So, I spent a couple of weeks trying out various Linux distros before settling on PopOS as my
            daily driver, with some Debian on older devices. It's been great fun! And it's made using Windows a lot less
            fun, unfortunately.</p>

          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>While these are very useful models for first learning how to self-evaluate, I've found more success with a
            more
            ecclectic approach in which I try out a bunch of methods, and Frankenstein them all together into an
            approach that suits me better as an individual. Any more strict adherence to a model has, in my experience,
            only
            led to time wasted in pointless arguments that could have been better spent building things.</p>

          <h4>POP - Planning</h4>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>Provide a detailed schedule for the following 2 weeks.</p>
          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>Having been immersed in the Agile methodology, I'm quite used to planning tasks and breaking them down into
            small components. Though I would rarely, if ever, enter in as much detail as we did during this assignment
            (the result of which can be viewed in <a href="#log">the log section</a>). If I did, I would likely spend
            about as much time planning my work as I would actually performing the tasks! Rather, I've found it useful
            to keep a simple list around, with each task in sequence. This is used as my actual work schedule, to
            provide rough timeboxing for the purposes of aligning schedules with colleagues for collaborative moments.
            Additionally, if timing is tight, I will provide a simple time estimation for each task ahead of time,
            typically no more precise than 30 minute intervals. This makes it easier to cut non-critical requirements if
            necessary, or to discuss possible rearrangements in the delivery schedule depending on priority of each
            task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h4>POP - Guest speaker</h4>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>Reflect on the lecture from a guest speaker working in the industry.</p>
          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>Interestingly, Oakfields hired Brightest to assess our testing process. Together, we developed a
            rudimentary testing plan, for which me and my colleague Fred were mainly responsible. Fred had gained prior
            experience as a tester working with Mobile Vikings, and it was very helpful to discuss approaches and
            tooling with him. Unfortunately, Oakfields ultimately did little with the TestRail suite we had developed,
            complete with unit tests for each business critical part of the product, as well as integrations with Jira
            and Zendesk for easy defect tracking. One day, I tried to log in to TestRail to reuse some of the scripts we
            had written. To my suprise, the login failed. When clarifying the matter with the P.M., I was informed that
            the TestRail license had been revoked as it was "no longer being used". We hadn't recieved any prior
            warning, and therefore did not have any way of retrieving any part of the tooling, scripts, logs, etc...
            This effectively meant that all the
            work Fred and I undertook in an effort to improve our process and help the business had been erased. Turned
            to atoms. I don't know if you can tell, but I am still a little bitter about that particular experience.</p>

          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>This particular assignment imposed the limitation of not allowing the use of frameworks, as well as
            discouraging the use of JavaScript. As such, it becomes an exercise in the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, which
            was a welcome refresher. Because the assignment itself wasn't particularily difficult, I decided to
            challenge myself to keep everything as simple as possible, and to limit the time I would allow myself to
            complete it. As expected, this resulted in a fun challenge at the cost of quality. It was particularily fun
            to actually implement some basic responsiveness in CSS, as this would typically not be done at my previous
            employer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h4>Cookie Clicker</h4>

            incremental game.</p>
          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>With my prior experience with C# during the Train4SmartServices course and a certain desire for challenge,
            I once again imposed a limitation on myself, as I had done with the CV assignment. I wanted to find out how
            far my currrent knowledge will get me, to paint a clear picture of where to improve in the next semester.
            And so, having completed most of the first iteration by December 2023, I gave myself about 48 hours for the
            final iterations. I was going for the sweaty, adrenaline-fueled atmosphere of a hackathon, and boy, did I
            succeed! It's not pretty, it has bugs, and I had to cut some functionalities due to lack of time (or rather,
            planning). But I can
            call it done, warts and all. This may seem quite extreme, bordering on irresponsible, from the perspective
            of a student trying to pass a class. But I've suffered through such situations in the past with more on the
            line than a simple grade, so I wanted to make the most out of this comparatively safe learning environment
            to really push myself, especially on the easier assignments.</p>

          <h5>Challenges & learnings</h5>
          <p>The most difficult part of this assignment is providing answers that are truthful without straying too far
            from the original questions. To address this, I have attempted to provide responses that are relevant to the
            question, but also demonstrate a broader and more general understanding of the topics at hand. If I had not
            made this adjustment, I would likely have little to say to each reflective question about which new
            knowledge was acquired. The total volume of work required has been relatively high compared to the learnings
            I've been able to extract from it so far, but I am patiently looking forward to the coming months, in
            which we will learn about more advanced topics. </p>

        <h4>Reflect about a POP-session: Kolb & STARR</h4>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
          <p>To be completely honest, not much. Though that's not really anyone's fault! This was one of the first
            POP-sessions, and it makes sense to start with one of the most important aspects of improvement:
            evaluation. The audience these lectures are designed for seems to be the beginner and young adult, as it
            should be. Unfortunately, I am neither of these things. I would certainly have appreciated being taught
            these methods in school, but I've managed to put together the basic principles over time by doing my own
            research (along with a lot of trial and error).</p>
          <h5>How does the knowledge transfer to daily life as a programmer?</h5>
          <p>Trying to improve without self-evaluating would be like flying blind. To successfully iterate, we need to
            draw conclusions from our previous work about which improvements to make and how to accomplish them. In
            order to generate and collect data that is consistent, and therefore useful, it makes sense to add
            structure to how and when we perform such evaluations. Kolb's model and the STARR-method are two examples
            of this. They're easy to understand for just about anybody, and reasonably effective too! Ultimately, I
            would prefer to move away from repackaging existing concepts under new terminology, and would rather teach
            the underlying principles. But keeping audience design in mind once more, the accessibility of the
            simplified models is more than enough to kickstart a positive feedback loop!</p>

          <h5>(Em)passie</h5>
          <p class="card-question">Wat is jouw passie? Hoe houdt dit verband met de opleiding die je bent aangevat?</p>
          <p>Het ontwikkelen, doorgronden, en verfijnen van systemen, specifiek met als doel het oplossen van praktische
            problemen. Dit is ongeveer de definitie van "engineering" (i.e.: ingenieurswezen), waarvan software
            ontwikkeling een vorm is. Bij de opleiding Graduaat Programmeren staat software ontwikkeling centraal.</p>
          <p class="card-question">Wat geeft jou energie en goesting? En hoe zie je dit in je opleiding die je bent
            aangevat?</p>
          <p>Het aanleren van nieuwe manieren om dingen aan te pakken of problemen op te lossen, m.a.w. innovatie,
            onderzoek, ontwikkeling. Ik leer liefst al doende, door projecten te bouwen, beperkingen op te leggen, en
            aandachtig te analyzeren.</p>
          <p class="card-question">Hoe zie je jezelf in dialoog gaan met anderen in de opleiding die je bent aangevat?
          </p>
          <p>Als oudere student met relevante werkervaring kan ik waar nodig vragen beantwoorden, helpen bij het
            aanleren van
            moeilijkere concepten, of gewoon het moreel op peil houden door bijvoorbeeld anecdotes te vertellen over
            uitdagingen in mijn eigen professionele ervaringen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Ondernemend & innovatief</h5>
          <p class="card-question">Wat versta jij onder een ken-doementaliteit (ondernemend zijn in de brede zin van het
            woord) en hoe zie je
            dat in de opleiding die je bent aangevat?</p>
          <p>Het besef dat de collectieve kennis van het menselijk ras toegankelijk is op eender
            welk moment, verleent
            zich tot continue zelfverbetering. Er zijn minder obstakels dan ooit voor de nieuwsgierige geest.
            Ondernemend zijn betekent het veranderen van de stelling "Ik kan het niet" naar "Ik weet niet hoe dit moet,
            maar ik kan het verder exploreren." Onwetendheid is dus geen beperking van ons vermogen, maar een
            opportuniteit tot verrijking.</p>
          <p class="card-question">Hoe ver sta jij op dit moment al in een ken-doementaliteit?</p>
          <p>Ik heb ondertussen verschillende hobby's waar ik zo veel mogelijk vrije tijd aan spendeer, telkens
            vanuit eigen initiatief en als autodidact. Een paar voorbeelden: video & audio productie, elektronische
            muziekproductie met modulaire synthesizers, game development, technical writing, astronomie, en
            gewichtheffen.

          <h5>(Internationaal) Samen(net)werken</h5>
          <p class="card-question">Hoe ziet jouw netwerk er op dit moment uit? Kan je dit netwerk inzetten in functie
            van de opleiding die je
            hebt aangevat?</p>
          <p>Mijn ex-collega's uit mijn tijd bij Oakfields kan ik altijd contacteren via sociale media. Zij werken
            ondertussen bij Mediaan op de Corda Campus, dus ik verwacht zeker even af te spreken volgend semester om bij
            te praten! Verder heb ik ook nog een aantal andere contacten uit het Train4SmartServices traject in Heerlen
            dat ik enkele jaren geleden heb doorlopen.</p>
          <p class="card-question">Hoe zou jij internationaal samen kunnen werken in de opleiding die je hebt aangevat?
          </p>
          <p>Het grote merendeel van de langetermijnsbeslissingen die ik maak doelen op internationale samenwerking.
            Elke computer krijgt internationale taal- en landsinstellingen, met voertaal in het Engels, en QWERTY
            layout. Ik communiceer voornamelijk in het Engels waar mogelijk om mijn taalvaardigheid te onderhouden en
            verbeteren, aangezien Engels de lingua franca van IT is. Verder fungeerde ik vaak als tech support bij het
            plannen en ondersteunen van de conference calls tijdens sprint retrospectives en reviews. Ik heb met andere
            woorden alle middelen in huis om internationaal samen te werken, en heb ondertussen verschillende
            internationale contacten gelegd via mijn vorige werkgever.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="role-card">
          <h5>Multi- & disciplinariteit</h5>
          <p class="card-question">Wat weet je op dit moment al over de inhouden van je opleiding?</p>
          <p>Vanuit mijn ervaring als web developer heb ik kennis opgedaan over werken met o.a. JavaScript, SQL,
            Agile/Scrum, Git, Atlassian producten (Jira/Confluence/BitBucket). Verder heb ik in het Train4SmartServices
            traject ook een verkorte cursus C# doorlopen.</p>
          <p class="card-question">Met welke andere disciplines (opleidingen / beroepen / ...) zou jij in aanraking
            kunnen komen in je
            opleiding?</p>
          <p>Studenten onder departement PXL Digital, en daarbuiten studenten uit opleidingen zoals Bedrijfsmanagement
            (Business), of Communicatie (Media & Tourism). In principe kan IT in aanraking komen met eender welke andere
            discipline, op voorwaarde dat deze baat kan halen uit een softwarematige aanpak.</p>
